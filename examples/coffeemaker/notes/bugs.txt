There were multiple bugs which I have described below:

Bug 1:
testAddInventory()
'> 0' is used instead of '< 0' The level of positiveness in the sugar is completely wrong and the method addInventory.

Bug 2:
In the testAddRecipe(), NUM_RECIPES in CoffeeMaking.java the values were set to 4 which should be 3.


Bug 3:
deleteRecipe will not delete any recipe from the recipe array in testDeleteRecipe().

Bug 4:
testEditRecipe(), having 2 recipe with the same name is not allowed.editRecipe method should be looking at oldRecipe.


Bug 5:
Making coffee did not decrease the inventory.The testMakeCoffe() method is increasing the chocolate amount instead of decreasing it.
